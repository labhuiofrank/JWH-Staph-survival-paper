Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen capable of persisting in environmental waters. The aim of this study was to compare the survival of S. aureus over time in environmental water samples with different turbidity and salinity. Eighteen samples were collected from fresh and brackish water sources from two different sites on the east side of Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi. S. aureus was detected in microcosms for up to 71 days with standard microbial culturing techniques. On average, environmental concentrations of S. aureus were greatest in fresh and brackish waters of high turbidity, respectively. Models demonstrate that salinity and turbidity significantly predict environmental S. aureus concentrations. S. aureus persistence over the extent of the experiment was the greatest in high turbidity microcosms with T90’s of 147.8 days in brackish waters, and 80.8 days in freshwaters. This study indicates that saline, turbid waters, in the absence of sunlight, provides suitable conditions for enhanced persistence of S. aureus communities that may increase the risk of exposure in environmental waters.
